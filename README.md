# bank_statement_processing

Coded in Python 3.7
Dependent on Pandas 0.25 and matplotlib 1.31

This program was designed to work with the formatting Mazuma Credit Union bank statements, exported as .csv files. It plots bank account balance changes, monthly income, expenditures, and savings, as well as plotted sorted income by source by year as a bar graph.

This repository includes both .py and .ipynb (Juypter notebook) files. The graphs rendered by matplotlib.pyplot are less cumbersome when viewed from within the Juypter Notebook (as opposed to running the raw .py file from command line).
